# Google Apps Script API Endpoints
# SECURITY: Deploy your GAS as web app with "Execute as: Me" and "Who has access: Anyone"
# Then add additional validation in the script to check request origin
# Get this from: Apps Script > Deploy > New deployment > Web app

# Google reCAPTCHA v3
# SECURITY: Use reCAPTCHA v3 for bot protection
# Get site key from: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
# The secret key should ONLY be used on the server (GAS backend)

# Rate Limiting Configuration (Client-side)
# Maximum donation submissions per IP address within the time window
# Note: This is client-side only. Implement server-side rate limiting in GAS

# ============================================================
# ADDITIONAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================================
# 
# For Google Apps Script Backend:
# 1. Enable reCAPTCHA v3 validation on server side
# 2. Validate request origin (check referer header)
# 3. Implement rate limiting by IP address
# 4. Log all donation attempts for audit
# 5. Add timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
# 6. Use HTTPS only for all communications
# 7. Sanitize and validate all input data
# 8. Implement CORS properly
# 
# For Firebase:
# 1. Review and update Firestore security rules regularly
# 2. Enable Firebase App Check for additional security
# 3. Monitor Firebase usage and set budget alerts
# 4. Use Firebase Authentication for sensitive operations
# 
# For Production Deployment:
# 1. Use a proper secret management system (e.g., GitHub Secrets, Vault)
# 2. Rotate API keys and secrets periodically
# 3. Monitor API usage for anomalies
# 4. Set up alerts for suspicious activities
# 5. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
# 6. Enable HTTPS and HSTS
